# CANDI - Semantic Framework for CAN bus Data Decoding and Integration


## DBC Ontology:

The DBC Ontology provides a semantic model for representing CAN bus messaging, encoding, and observations. It extends the W3C SSN/SOSA ontology to capture CAN database (DBC)-specific concepts such as messages, signals, logs, and ECUs. Designed for the transportation domain, the ontology supports advanced analytics, condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and real-time diagnostics.
